# README
This folder contains all the starter workflows for the Brandwatch org

Please remember that GitHub requires this repo to be public for these flows to be usable so do not commit anything sensitive into this repo.

If you need to put sensitive info in your flow, please create a shared workflow or step in the private `bw-workflow-actions` repo.

These shared workflow startes are created as per this doc: https://docs.github.com/en/actions/using-workflows/creating-starter-workflows-for-your-organization
